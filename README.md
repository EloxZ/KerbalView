# KerbalView Mod
Allows a glimpse of the galaxy through the eyes of kerbals.

# How it works
- Press [Alt] + [2] in Flight Camera Mode Auto to get into First Person View. Press again or change camera mode with V to exit.
- Currently is using the native controls and the camera is locked.
    - [A] and [D] to rotate
    - [Q] and [E] to slide sideway
    - In space you can use [Q] and [E] as yaw 
- Field Of View is set to 90.

# Known issues
- Camera clips with Kerbal when they start an idle animation. I could hide Kerbal Model, but the purpose is to be as immersive as it can be.
- Bad controls
- I think I solved every bug I got into, feel free to comment me your issues.

# Next feautures
- Revamped controls on land and space (Jetpack)
- Immersive vision
- Configurable values
