# KerbalView Mod
Allows a glimpse of the galaxy through the eyes of kerbals.

# How it works
- In Flight Camera Mode Auto, press Alt + 2 to get into first person view. Press again or press V to exit.
- Currently is using the native controls and the camera is locked.
    [A] and [D] to rotate
    [Q] and [E] to slide sideway
    In space you can only use [Q] and [E] as yaw
- Field Of View is set to 90.

# Known issues
- Camera clips with Kerbal when they start an idle animation. I could hide Kerbal Model, but the purpose is to be as immersive as it can be.
- Bad controls.
- I think I solved every bug I got into, feel free to comment me your issues.

# Next feautures
- Revamped controls on land and space (Jetpack).
- Immersive vision.
- Configurable values.
